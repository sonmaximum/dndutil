# dndutil/DNDPIMP

Work in progress!

dndutil is a project I made to practice programming a stand-alone application in Python and Django.

The main app is called DNDPIMP, a Dungeons and Dragons Party Inventory Management Platform.

It is still under construction, but the basic models for users, characters, parties, and items currently exist.

When complete, a user will be able to keep track of items owned by any of their characters, as well as by the party collectively, and list these items' quantities and values.

Characters are assigned to parties, so shared items can be tracked and so that users can have multiple characters.

I eventually hope to implement a system to allow the user to indicate whether they intend to keep and use items (e.g. "equipment") or sell it ("loot").
